OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model serves as a conceptual framework, systematically categorizing network communication functions into seven distinct layers. This model establishes a universal language for computer networking, facilitating communication between various technologies through the adoption of standard protocols or communication rules. It encapsulates all forms of network communication across both software and hardware components. In essence, the OSI model provides a structured and comprehensive approach to networking, ensuring interoperability and standardized communication across diverse devices and applications.
